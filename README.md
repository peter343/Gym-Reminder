# Gym-Reminder
<b>SUMMARY</b>

Gym-Reminder is a program that accesses the current time and date, 
to figure out if the current date is a day the user should go to the gym.

<b>WHAT IT SHOWS</b>

The program first displays whether or not it is a gym-day. It then 
displays the day, date, and time, and asks the user
what time they plan on going to the gym.


<b>HOW IT WORKS</b>

Gym-Reminder works by converting the time difference between the current time, and the time the user plans on going to the gym, to milliseconds. The program is then instructed to sleep for the defined amount of milliseconds.
When the program wakes up, it prompts the user to say whether or not they went to the gym.

<b>WHAT IT OUTPUTS</b>

After the user is asked if they went to the gym or not, the program will display various windows depending on which buttons the user presses. *WARNING Gym-Reminder currently has explicit language as a possible output. The messages displayed were for my own entertainment. Use at your own risk!*

<b>FUTURE PLANS</b>

Soon I will upload the .jar file and the program will be available to anyone.
Also, it is currently an automatic start-up program on my system only. Will possibly create an option for it to do so automatically without the user having to change their system settings.
